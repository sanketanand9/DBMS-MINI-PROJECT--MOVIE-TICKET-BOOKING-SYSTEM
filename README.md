# DBMS-MINI-PROJECT--MOVIE-TICKET-BOOKING-SYSTEM
In this project, we have designed a database to store information about the Movie-Ticket booking. 
The database will contain information about the customers and will be accessible to only the database administrator.
This database will contain the details of the customers, movies, price of tickets, reserved seats ,
payment options available , capacity of theatre and type of seats available in a theatre etc.
